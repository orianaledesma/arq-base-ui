### Files Structure

```
src/
    assets/
    components/
        CustomComponent.jsx
    helpers/
        utilities.js
    service/
        callServices.js
    views/
        SectionName/
            Home.jsx
            _home.scss
```

**Note:** The name of the Root Component section should be equals as folderName e.x SectionName = Home and component = Home.jsx
